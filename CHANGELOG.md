## [0.9.1] 2023-06-14

### Changed

- Fixed dispatcher to not finish empty epoch

## [0.9.0] 2023-05-19

### Added

- Added support to Cartesi Machine snapshots
- [Script](onchain/rollups/test/foundry/dapp/helper/README.md) for updating proofs used in unit tests
- Authority consensus model implementation (single validator)
- Simple claim storage implementation (one claim per DApp)
- Library that defines several constants related to the canonical off-chain machine
- Added integration tests for proxy
- DApp Address Relay contract (allows the off-chain machine to know the DApp's address)
- Added outputs to rollups events
- Added new indexer that consumes broker events

### Changed

- Simplified the on-chain architecture (not backwards-compatible)
- Adopted [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for contract testing (Hardhat is still being used for deployment)
- `CartesiDApp` does not implement [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) anymore
- Made each Portal a contract of their own, and shared amongst all the DApps
- Made inputs added by Portals more compact by using the [packed ABI encoding](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) instead of the standard one
- Made ERC-20 deposits more generic by allowing base layer transfers to fail, and adding a boolean field signaling whether it was successful or not
- Made ERC-721 deposits more generic by adding an arbitrary data field to be interpreted by the off-chain machine in the execution layer
- Moved the input boxes of every DApp into a single, permissionless contract
- Input boxes are now append-onlyâ€”they are not cleared every new epoch (old Input Facet)
- Modularized the consensus layer (a DApp can now seamlessly change its consensus model)
- Modularized the claim storage layer (a consensus can now seamlessly change how it stores claims)
- Voucher bitmask position is now determined by the input index (in the input box) and output index
- Validators need now to specify the range of inputs of each claim they submit on-chain
- Refactor GraphQL API for simplified architecture
- Bumped grpc-interfaces to 0.12.0
- Changed inspect-server to use new server-manager interface
- Changed advance-runner to use new server-manager interface

### Removed

- Setup Input
- Quorum consensus model implementation (up to 8 validators)
- Bank contract
- DApp configuration parameters related to the off-chain machine specs (now defined as constants)
- Removed `epochIndex` field from `OutputValidityProof` struct
- Removed headers from inputs added by trusted permissionless contracts like portals and relayers
- Remove polling-based indexer

## [0.8.2] 2023-01-04

### Changed

### Added

- Support of gnosis chiado testnet

### Changed

- Fixed epoch finalization when running rollups in host mode

## [0.8.0] 2022-11-29

### Added

- Added the rollups-events crate that works as an abstraction to producing and consuming events.
- Added the server-manager-broker-proxy service to consume events from the broker and manage the server-manager.
- Added request id to server-manager calls
- Added server-manager session config as CLI arguments
- Store DApp deployment information in JSON instead of plain text
- Compatibility with networks without EIP1559 transactions

### Changed

- New container with hardhat and deployed contracts for test environment
- New command line tool to deploy DApps

### Changed

- Moved logic from `erc721Deposit` function to `onERC721Received`
- Renamed `ERC721Deposited` event to `ERC721Received` and added `operator` field
- Validators who lost a dispute are removed from the validator set, and cannot redeem fees from previous claims
- Changed the visibility of `Bank`'s state variables to private
- Changed the visibility of `LibClaimsMask`'s functions to internal
- Improved docker entrypoints and configuration
- Gas optimizations

### Deprecated
