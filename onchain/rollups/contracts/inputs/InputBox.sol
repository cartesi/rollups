///
/// The hash that is stored on-chain is composed by the hash of the input blob,
/// the block number and timestamp, the input sender address, and the input index.
///
/// Data availability is guaranteed by the emission of `InputAdded` events
/// on every successful call to `addInput`. This ensures that inputs can be
/// retrieved by anyone at any time, without having to rely on centralized data
/// providers.
///
/// From the perspective of this contract, inputs are encoding-agnostic byte
/// arrays. It is up to the DApp to interpret, validate and act upon inputs.
